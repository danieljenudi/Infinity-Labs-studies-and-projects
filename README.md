# Data Structures and System Utilities

This repository contains a collection of self-implemented **data structures** in both **C** and **C++**, along with various **Makefiles** to build and manage the projects efficiently.  
The goal of this repository is to provide a solid foundation for practicing low-level programming, memory management, and performance-oriented design.

## Contents

### Data Structures
- Implementations of classical data structures from scratch in C and C++.
- Emphasis on efficiency, memory handling, and clean API design.
- Example categories include:
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Hash Tables
  - Trees
  - Custom containers and utilities

### Build System
- Multiple **Makefiles** are included across the repository.
- Each Makefile is tailored for the relevant project or module:
  - Supports both `make` and `make clean`.
  - Handles dependency management and incremental builds.
  - Provides reusable targets for compilation, testing, and cleaning.

## Projects

In addition to data structures, the repository includes several applied system-level projects.  
Each project is placed inside its own directory. Below are the descriptions with placeholders for links:

1. **[Thread Pool](cpp/thread_pool)**  
   Design Pattern implementation. Provides multi-threaded task execution and thread reuse.

2. **[Watch Dog](c/utils/wd)**  
   A fail-safe tool to watch over processes from collapsing or freezing.

3. **[Network Attached Storage](projects/network_attached_storage) (Work in Progress)**  
   An application for an in-house cloud storage system with multiple storage devices.
